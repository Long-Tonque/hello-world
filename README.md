# hello-world
Just a repository
Hello! My name is Maksim but you can just call me Max. I am living in Estonia, Tallinn.
I decided to learn programming because i want to create something special, something very useful for all kind of people. And today is many services are digitalized. So i think this is the best way to grow nowadays.
This is so cool to be in Github =) 
I love SNUS
